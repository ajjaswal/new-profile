# new-profile

## Description

I used mainly javascript to create a team profile generator that can be used to make an HTML document displaying data for managers, engineers, and interns. I first created classes for each type of employee to determine what information would be relevant to each one. Then I used jest to create tests for each class. For the program itself I used Node.js and Inquire to create a program that asks what information you want on the team profile (name, employee ID, email, number, github, etc.) and outputs it in the HTML document onto the card with a matching icon. I used "path" to easily create an HTML document in the "dist" folder when using the program.
